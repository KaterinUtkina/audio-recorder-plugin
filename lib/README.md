## API

### `AudioRecorderPlugin`

The `AudioRecorderPlugin` provides a simple interface for recording audio in the browser. Below are the methods available in the plugin:

#### `init(): Promise<void>`

Initializes the audio recorder. This method must be called before starting the recording. It sets up any necessary resources and ensures the recorder is ready for use.

#### `startRecording(): Promise<void>`

Starts the audio recording process. This method begins capturing audio from the user's microphone. Make sure to call `init()` successfully before invoking this method.

#### `stopRecording(): Promise<HTMLAudioElement>`

Stops the audio recording process and returns an `HTMLAudioElement` containing the recorded audio. The returned audio element can be appended to the DOM or used for playback.
